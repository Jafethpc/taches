# Taches Task Tracker
This application has the ability to add tasks, edit, save, and delete them.

# Changes to come in the future!
There are many things I want this application to do including:
- Adding a calendar
- Adding a user login profile
- Render deleted tasks
- Render favorite/prioritized tasks
- Use an MVC model with routes

# Difficulties
Some difficulties I had were when it came to data files and trying to parse and access different objects inside of it. I believe this difficulty came due to me making changes to the style of the application midway through the project which I feel I should've done in the beginning. Another difficulty I had was trying to understand how parameters worked and also how to use view engine templates. This is my first project working with a view engine template(PUG) and it was an amazing experience but a difficult one.
